# IPAs in America

In this project, I scraped 687k ratings of over 700 American IPAs from almost 400 breweries on beeradvocate.com.  I then used breweriesâ€™ geocoded addresses to create a Shiny app that mapped the location of beers in such a way to facilitate the identification of highly rated, popular beers.  The app includes the ability to filter on metrics such as Abv, number of ratings, and overall rating.
